This a fully custom designed Content Management System I made for a showcase. There are three user types: admin, editor, and user. Admins and editors have their own dashboards. This application is also fully responsive.

Admins can:
  - Create, Update, and Delete users. (Except other admins)
  - Create, Update, and Delete articles.
  - Delete users' profile statuses.
  
Editors can:
  - Create, Update, and Delete articles.
  
Everyone can:
  - Read articles.
  - Create personal profile statuses.
  - Delete their own profile statuses.
  - Edit their own profile information.
